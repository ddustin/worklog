Splicing done sept week ending Oct 31

* Had a theory that messages were getting sent to the wrong daemons
    * Added a new type of error “SPLICE_WRONG_OWNER”
    * Made lightningd report this error in some places I was investigating
* Found a rather difficult memleak bug
    * The method `psbt_input_set_serial_id` for setting serial_ids creates an ‘key’ object
        * This key is allocated into whatever memory context is passed in
    * The code *looks* like it’s passing memory onto psbt with `psbt_input_set_unknown` however it isn’t
    * Typically, the memory context would be tmpctx, which is automatically cleaned. But in some cases it is passed a NULL context (meaning its memory will be managed manually)
    * This combination of events was happening when the complex signing splice test occurred.
* Fixed up the bug in this PR:
    * https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/5665
* While important for splicing, this PR may fix memory leaks in other obscure situations in the code base so it made sense to get it in on its own
* Gearing up to do payment tests during the various pre-/mid-splicing stages
* Then gearing up to test block-confirmed splices
* Then payment tests again post various block confirmation counts

Part Two
* Implemented dynamic splice_lock flow for when nodes see confirmation at different times
* Updated CLN splice RPC interface to show clearer error messages
* Improved splice test to handle all phases of splice and bundled it
* Moved out developer debug code in preparation for code merge
* Performed a fresh rebase of CLN codebase
* Completed the validation of splice commitments & HTLCs
* Segregated work into logical code commits for CLN merging
* Made draft PR on the CLN code base!
