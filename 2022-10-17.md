Splicing done sept week ending Oct 17

* In person events:
    * Spoke about lightning & splicing at the Scottâ€™s Mining Layer 2 event in Texas
    * Helped onboard new core lightning users & potential contributors at Tabconf in Atlanta
* Splice Test Work
    * So excited to be back working on the core tests needed to get splicing released
    * The testing framework is finding quite a few obscure bugs that only appear inside it. A few of them are:
        * Message timing related issues. Since the test happens faster, channel update messages were coming through while inflight messages were expected
            * fix is to ignore but queue the channel update messages when waiting for inflight
        * A PSBT validation issue was exposed for towire/fromwire sending of PSBTs.
            * Worked with Lisa to diagnose it and she ended up putting the fixes in this PR https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/5649
    * Got a successful 0-splice (essentially a splice that does not change the channel capacity) running in the testing framework (woooo!!).
    * Implemented a more complicated splice that automatically gets funds and added them to an existing channel while merging PSBTs etc
        * It *almost* works. All steps are working except the final signing
        * Hope to get the final signing working soon
            * This will (hopefully ðŸ¤ž) free me up to start being able to work quickly on launching lots of complex tests and get some good splicing coverage
* Package manager work
    * Working with new developers at Tapconf a common request was using the â€˜brewâ€™ package manger for Mac to easily install core lightning
        * Worked with Dread, Vivec, and Sam Jones on the first day.
        * The package manager ran into issues compiling core lightning
        * Sam Jones & I spent the next few days diagnosing the problem
            * It was a combination of a linux sandbox issue and a dependency issue
            * CoreLightning uses lowdown for part of its build system and that code automatically puts itself in a sandbox
            * Because brew is already in a sandbox, the sandbox inception blows up the build
        * We came up with multiple solutions. The ideal solution is to get a PR through lowdown which I put up here: https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown/pull/108
            * If that PR gets approved, some small changes will be needed in CoreLightning and we should be good
            * If it doesnâ€™t get approved weâ€™ll go down the more complex paths of making it work
        * The nearly completed brew package is here: https://gist.github.com/ddustin/08be559ec3e52b58c212a309d1b2546c
            * But I canâ€™t recommend its usage until we get the PRâ€™s approved by the GitHub admins

Tasks for next cycle:
* Get the first complex test working complete (fixing any bugs that come up)
* Start building lots of complex tests!
