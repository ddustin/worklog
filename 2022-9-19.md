* Ran into Core Lightning flakiness issues on Mac tests
* figured I’d rebase to see if that magically fixed things for me before getting too deep
* found overlap issues with funding_locked & splice_locked
    * 0-conf changed funding_locked a *lot*
    * got post-rebase splice code compiling
    * had low confidence splice_lock’ing would work after rebase
    * tried diagnosing those problems
* Got WIRE_TEMPORARY_CHANNEL_FAILURE a bunch
    * in diving into what could be causing that
    * decided to clean my givens and do some tests on raw master
    * this began my side quest
* side quest: on my Mac WIRE_TEMPORARY_CHANNEL_FAILURE issue was pretty frequent on master tip
    * decide to dive into why that was happening
    * explored a ton of things that weren’t the problem
        * learned a ton about the new connect flow
        * learned a ton about the node <-> node channel socket initiation flow
        * learned a ton about inter-daemon communication
    * did a lot of digging into things that weren’t the problem — but learned a lot about the code base!
    * it appears my issue was inter-daemon fd/socket management!
    * once I understood the issue (a week later lol) found a one liner that fixed it!
        * PR’ed the one line fix
* Now its reliable on my machine!

Upcoming work:

* Now I’m back to finishing the splice rebase, so that’s exciting
* Going to go clean up my pending PRs this week too
